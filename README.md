# Four-in-a-row
Four in a row game for the browser as project sample code part of four in a row game course challenge

## Welcome
This game was a practice course as a postcursor to an object oriented javascript lesson. I completed the lesson, and the 
ongoing challenge in the lesson was building the game based on the instruction parts of the lesson. Due to a bug with the code,
I had to use the final step code even though I had written the same (but not exact) program in a previous folder. The code was
missing from the final step folder but another student had published the code that would have been there if not for the different bug.
In here you will see a replica of his code but note that I had gone through the lesson. I hope you enjoy!

## Getting Started
To get started, follow one of these two options:
1. Local Server
* Download the project files either through the git terminal or by downloading the zip
* If you are using the git terminal, find the folder in your file explorer/finder, and if you are downloading
by zip, extract the zip files and find the newly created folder in your file explorer/finder
a. Opening with text editor/Visual Studio Code
* Open up the project folder with your text editor, and either view the index.html file with whatever button allows you to view
that is specific to your text editor, and if you are on Visual Studio Code and have the live server extension, create a live server for
index.html and view the server in your browser
b. Opening with file viewer (**Faster**)
* Double click/run the index.html file
* You should be able to see the file path with the index.html file in your browser
2. Website
* **COMING SOON!**


*Enjoy!*
